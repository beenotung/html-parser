The real parser for html that return the dom (tree) structure.

## Why @beenotung/html-parser
I tried to find a html parser for node.js.

I found many complicated libraries that don't work for me.

And I found some simple libraries that is too low level, requiring me to handle open and close of element, are you kidding me?
That looks like tokenizer (higher level though) than a parser.

## Future work
To implement query selector.
